### Summary:
============
The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set, thereby creating a tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smart phone. It was collected by Anguita et al. (2012). A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data used for the project:

## run_analysis.R script creates a tidy data set as following:
===============================================================
- Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- Creating a second, independent tidy data set (average_variable_activity_subject.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
